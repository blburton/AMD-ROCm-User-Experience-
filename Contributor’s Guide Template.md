#### 1.1. Pull-request Guidelines 
Our code contriubtion guidelines closely follows the model of [GitHub pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Pull requests should:

- Target the develop branch for integration.

- Ensure code builds successfully.

- Do not break existing test cases.

- New functionality will only be merged with new unit tests.

- New unit tests should integrate within the existing googletest framework.

- Tests must have good code coverage.

- Code must also have benchmark tests, and performance must approach the compute bound limit or memory bound limit.
